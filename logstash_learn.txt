Kibana Dashboard steps:

steps:
1. setup Dataviews for the Index that we want to check logs.
2. Analytics -> Discover we can search logs.

ElasticSearch server - http://localhost:9200/
Kibana dashboard - http://localhost:5601/

check indices - http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices/ & http://localhost:9200/{index_name}/_search sample - http://localhost:9200/logstash_log/_search

logstash command - 

In Kibana.yml file we need to uncomment below:
server.port: 5601
server.host: "localhost"
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
elasticsearch.username: "kibana_system"
elasticsearch.password: "tMS-zZT8oF7*dklO1OTq"

In Logstash need to write conf file which has the details of elasticsearch and logs details -sample learn.conf. C:\ELK_Stack\logstash-8.4.2\config

-> elasticsearch needs to get password from logs once we got after server start
-> we need to update cluster.name and path.data in elasticsearch.yml file. also need to make ssl to false.

In Project
-> need to setup logfile with below properties in Spring boot project.
 logging:
  file:
    name: C:/ELK_Stack/logs/elk-stack.log
-> set the log file name in logstash .conf file to create indexes. once we run the logstash file with command (logstash -f ./config/learn.conf) 
logs will be listen from logstash and that will create indices.
-> index will get created and elasticsearch will pick up the logs, logs will get added to Kibana dashboard.
